## Introduction ✍️

This page is to introduce me to others 😉

I can almost say that if someone wants to get to know me, I give them this page so they can read about me on this page 😁

The summary of this source is my portfolio website which has very, very high graphics 👍

If you like my personal website, you can give this repository one star ⭐

## Features 🛰️

- **Operating System Like**: The design of this page is like an operating system. So I have considered all the characteristics of an operating system. For more information and a better understanding of this sentence, you can use the project demo 😅
